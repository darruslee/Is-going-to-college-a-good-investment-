Analyzing the Monetary Effect of Going to College on Annual Earnings 
## Introduction
With some in the public beginning to question the value gained from attaining higher education, this report was written with a clear objective in mind – to use past data to analyze whether such claims were substantiated or merely beliefs rippling throughout popular society. To answer the question of whether going to college is a worthwhile investment or not, we used data gathered from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey randomly selected and tracked roughly 6,000 men and women born between the years 1957 and 1964 and captured detailed records of each participant’s life and upbringing. However, for the purposes of this analysis, we chose a little under 4,000 individual observations to work with. Our hope with this report is that the analyses contained within it help explore the earnings gap between college graduates and non-graduates, explaining the impact various variables have on people’s earnings and allowing readers to understand the isolated monetary effect going to college has on their future earnings.
