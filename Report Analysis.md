Analyzing the Monetary Effect of Going to College on Annual Earnings 
## Introduction
With some in the public beginning to question the value gained from attaining higher education, this report was written with a clear objective in mind – to use past data to analyze whether such claims were substantiated or merely beliefs rippling throughout popular society. To answer the question of whether going to college is a worthwhile investment or not, we used data gathered from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, conducted by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey randomly selected and tracked roughly 6,000 men and women born between the years 1957 and 1964 and captured detailed records of each participant’s life and upbringing. However, for the purposes of this analysis, we chose a little under 4,000 individual observations to work with. Our hope with this report is that the analyses contained within it help explore the earnings gap between college graduates and non-graduates, explaining the impact various variables have on people’s earnings and allowing readers to understand the isolated monetary effect going to college has on their future earnings. 
## Descriptive Statistics on Earnings for College Graduates and Non-Graduates
Before we begin analyzing the sources of the earnings gap between college graduates and non-graduates, it is helpful to understand what the earnings gap is without taking other variables into consideration. As shown in Figure 1, on average, non-college graduates earned $31,881 per year, while graduates earned $80,150 per year. This amounts to an on-average annual difference of $48,269 in earnings. However, discussion of the mean is not complete without further analyzing the accompanying median value: the annual earnings of an individual located at the 50th percentile. Taken together, the mean and the median show relative skewness, or the existence and influence of outliers on the dataset. For non-graduates, the mean and median ($25,000) are roughly close together, while for graduates, their difference is much larger. This indicates that outliers like those who made $312,324 a year may have affected the average annual earnings of graduates more, although both graduate and non-graduate datasets appear to have outliers within them. Just taking medians into consideration, there still exists a substantial $35,000 annual earnings gap between college graduates and non-graduates at the 50th-percentile level, appearing to show at a surface-level that graduates tend to earn more than non-graduates.
